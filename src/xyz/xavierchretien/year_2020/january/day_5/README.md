## Problem

Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That, is given a string of length `N` and a pattern of length `k`, write a program that searches for the 
pattern in the string with less than `O(N * k)` worst-case time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return `False`.
