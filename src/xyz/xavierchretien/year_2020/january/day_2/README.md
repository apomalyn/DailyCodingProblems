## Problem

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index.
Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise return `false`.

For example:
   - Given `[-6, 0, 2, 40]`, you should return `2`
   - Given `[1, 5, 7, 8]`, you should return `false`
